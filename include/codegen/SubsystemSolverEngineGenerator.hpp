	\brief Generates top-level code for a LB-LMC simulation solver engine of a network subsystem

	This generator is used to generate solver engine functions for subsystems of a network system
	that is decomposed using Nodal Decomposition under LB-LMC method.  The subsystem is expected
	to have ports which are to be interfaced to the ports of other subsystems in a system during
	simulation.  The execution flow of the solver function generated with this generator follows
	a different order than that of the monolithic system solver; This subsystem solver flow is as
	such:

	1. read port exchanges from other subsystems\n
	2. aggregrate component source contributions and port exchanges into b vector\n
	3. solve subsystem Gx=b for x and update solution (subsystem and internal) outputs\n
	4. read signal inputs for components\n
	5. update models/behavior of each component from solution x, past states, and signal inputs\n
	6. compute port exchanges of this subsystem to be passed to other subsystem solvers\n
	7. output subsystem and internal solutions of past time step t along with port exchanges of
	current time step t+dt, where dt is length of time step.

	\note This class does not check if the engine code it generates is valid C++.  It is up to the
	user to ensure the given information to the generator is correct to ensure the generated code
	is valid.

		\brief defines the Norton model of a subsystem as seen from a port

		A port of a subsystem is two paired terminals where the subsystem is connected to the rest
		of a system network.  A subsystem must have 1 or more ports to rest of system; otherwise,
		it is not a subsystem but a system of itself.

		A Norton model at a port is defined as a conductance Y across the two terminals of a port,
		along with a transconductance dependent voltage-controlled current source T and a functional
		current source H in parallel to this conductance. For a subsystem, the Norton port model
		represents the equivalency of the subsystem as seen from the port, where Y is the
		equivalent conductance, T is the coupling conductance seen from other ports on the
		subsystem, and H is the weighted summation of all source contributions in the subsystem.

		These objects are used to define the port models of a subsystem, these models being computed
		by SubsystemSimulationEngineGenerator.

		\see NortonPort for a component generator that can realize this model into an actual
		component
