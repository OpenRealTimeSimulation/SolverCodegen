/**
	\brief Loads a LB-LMC Model Definition from a plain text netlist file or string

	A netlist of a LB-LMC system model defines the components and network connections between these
	components that make up the model.

	The NetlistLoader requires the following the syntax rules for a given netlist:

	Each command, comment, and component definition in netlist must exist in a single line ending
	with newline.

	Comments are started by a % character.

	Commands are started by a # character.

	Components are started by type-name of component.

	The model in netlist must be given a name using command #name model_name which must be called
	before any other command or component definition, like so:
	<pre>
	#name rlc_circuit_model
	</pre>

	Model constants can be defined in the netlist using command #const const_name const_value, like
	so:
	<pre>
	#const DT 50.0e-9
	#const Resistance 10.0
	</pre>
	The name of constant cannot be a command or comment and must consist of alphanumerical and
	underscore characters.  Constants must be defined before components
	The constant is referenced in netlist by inserting the constant's name, like so:
	<pre>
	#const Res 100.0
	%...
	Resistor R1(Res) {2 3}
	</pre>
	The constant must be defined before it is used in netlist

	The syntax for a component in the name follows:
	<pre>
	component_type name (parameter list) { node indices }
	</pre>
	An example for a 2 terminal capacitor is:
	<pre>
	% 1st param is time step in seconds, 2nd param is capacitance in Farads
	Capacitor cap1 (10e-6, 10e-3) { 1, 2 }
	</pre>

	Indices must be positive from 0 onwards.  The index 0 indicates the system model's common/ground
	point.
