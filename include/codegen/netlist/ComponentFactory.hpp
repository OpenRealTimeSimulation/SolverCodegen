/**
	\brief constructs LB-LMC component code generators from given component type and parameters

	Component (code generator) factories construct component code generators from given component
	parameters and type, then returning an observing pointer to the constructed object.
	These factories do not construct the generator objects themselves, instead using
	ComponentProducer objects to constructor them, which are registered under a factory under the
	component type.
	This allows the factories to be flexible and support new component generators as they are
	created without modifying the factory class.
