/**
	\brief Defines a System composed of Component Objects which from a C++ LB-LMC
	solver can be code generated to simulate

	Objects of this class store Component objects that define a system network model using LB-LMC
	method.  From these components and their network connections, a System object can generate
	C++ solver code, using SimulationEngineGenerator, to compute solutions and simulate for the
	model.

	System objects require components to all have unique names in same model for code
	generation, and these names must be valid C++ labels (no operators, no spaces, and
	no reserved words; only alphanumerical and underscore characters allowed).
