/**
	\brief Describes a controlled source resistive companion element for a Component

	Controlled sources are ideal voltage and current sources which are controlled by a measured
	voltage or current (multiplied by a gain) across/through terminals elsewhere in a system.  These
	components cannot be modeled by typical 2-terminal resistive companion elements (current source
	with parallel conductance, or ideal voltage source), so they are described by special resistive
	companion elements of 4 terminals with this type.

	\see VoltageControlledCurrentSource code generator class for creating such a component
	\see VoltageControlledVoltageSource code generator class for creating such a component
	\see CurrentControlledCurrentSource code generator class for creating such a component
	\see CurrentControlledVoltageSource code generator class for creating such a component
